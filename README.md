Hello There!

I have a question about the navigation on the right in the header. 

I'm not happy about the position of the navigation and how it reacts when I make the browser window smaller. 
Right now, the space between the navigation and the edge of the browser is not fix.
And also as soon as i make the window smaller, the words start take two rows. why?

How can I manage that it's aligned on the right with a fix margin also when I make the window smaller? 

I couldn't manage to get this also in the my times exercise. 

I'd be very pleased to recive your help!

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Antea
